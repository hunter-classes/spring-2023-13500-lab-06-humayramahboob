/* In a Caesar cipher, each letter is always 
shifted by the same number of positions. What 
if we shifted each letter by a different value? 
Such a code would be much harder to break. This 
encryption strategy is known as the Vigenere cipher.

Since each letter of plaintext must be shifted 
differently, a single right-shift parameter is 
not sufficient, we need to have a sequence of 
such shifts. This sequence is determined by a 
keyword, in which each letter corresponds to 
specific shift: a shifts by 0, b shifts by 1, 
c shifts by 2, and so on. The n-th letter of 
the alphabet will shift by n âˆ’ 1 to the right.
